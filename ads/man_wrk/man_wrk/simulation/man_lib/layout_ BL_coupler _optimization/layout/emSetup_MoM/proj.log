Simulation started on: Thu Apr 18 16:54:51 2024
Simulation Mode: uW
Substrate to be computed from 3.1 GHz to 3.9 GHz!
Substrate calculation started

Substrate calculation finished
Using the minimal snap distance of 0.004 mil
(4 layout resolution points) for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.001 mil.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.
