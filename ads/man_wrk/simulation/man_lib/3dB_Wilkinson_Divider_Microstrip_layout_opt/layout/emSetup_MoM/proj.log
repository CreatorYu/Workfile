Momentum MomEngine_64 2020.00.283 (*) built: Jul 17 2019
Copyright  1992 - 2019 Keysight Technologies
Simulation started on: Fri Apr 26 14:36:46 2024
Simulation Mode: uW
Substrate valid
Using the minimal snap distance of 0.004 mm
(4 layout resolution points) for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.001 mm.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P4" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P4" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.
