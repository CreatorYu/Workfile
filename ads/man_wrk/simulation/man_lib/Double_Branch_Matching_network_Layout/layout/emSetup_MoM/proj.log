Momentum MomEngine_64 2020.00.283 (*) built: Jul 17 2019
Copyright  1992 - 2019 Keysight Technologies
Simulation started on: Thu Mar 28 00:00:10 2024
Simulation Mode: uW
Substrate valid
Using the minimal snap distance of 0.004 mil
(4 layout resolution points) for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.001 mil.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.
